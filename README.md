## About the Video Course
With its focus on new and modern mobile, Cloud, and desktop development capabilities, Visual Studio's overall acquisition, performance, and general developer productivity have improved; it starts faster, is more responsive, and uses less memory than before.
In this course, you learn about increasing reliability and performance with Visual Studio 2017. This course starts by setting up a Continuous Integration configuration in Visual Studio Team Services to run unit tests on every code change. Next, we introduce tools that can improve the effectiveness of manual testing. You will be introduced to Microsoft Test Manager, to organize test processes more effectively; IntelliTrace for easier reproduction of issues encountered; and UI tests, to automate repetitive regression testing. You will configure Visual Studio Team Services to automatically build code and run unit tests whenever a change is committed to source control. The course focuses on Microsoft Test Manager features that can be used to gain more control over the manual testing process. 
The last sections will focus on tools for improving application performance: profiling and load testing.
